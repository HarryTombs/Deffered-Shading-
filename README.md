# Programming project
*Harry Ben Brass Tombs*

As of right now i've got two main ideas as to what i'd like to do and i am not sure which nessisarily to pursue based on my skill level and the the amount of time i've got to do them, this first steps is just going to be a brains storm as to what i like

## USD -inator
Usd is kind of confusing to use from an artists perspective, I have experienced people learn what i feel are a few short steps and get tripped up by the little annoyances that come with the file type. Obviously this can be solved by better education of the artists using it but i can see something like a "USD -inator" being a thing companies would want to invent
### THE PROBLEM WITH THAT
USD is way too varied in how it handles input types, requiring things like volumes particle effects and animations to have certain setups which can be subsided with a specific tool but inevitably feels like you're just pushing the goal post further down afield. So if there is a way to take non USDified file types click a button and its in the scene perfectly i think that would be a fun project, but realistically i don't think thats possible, without significant compromise and learning curve from the artist. Also artists aren't stupid if they want to use USD they'll learn the current methods to their own satisfaction

Robin has sent me a paper thats actually perfect thanks Robin

## Realtime Global illumination
The one suggested in the sample projects. This is me not trying to reinvent the wheel here. I get lighting systems and i know how they work already ,well enough to know (vaugely) how to approach this project, so doing a path tracer or something along those lines would interested me greatly. **I THINK IT WILL STILL BE VERY HARD** but i think its a more possible goal to achieve. 

I'd say im interterested in both projects but i think the global illumination would be my MAIN interest 

Oh wow look i've already found papers on it:

## Extra notes


As you can probably tell im not amazingly interested in simulation work proper, just cause my go to interest in CG has always been renedering, but i did see some cool simuation work on planets and such at BFX if i'd like an absolute backup plan

I frankly have no idea whats way too easy and whats absoluetly ridiculous to do in the span of a few months so advice would be helpful 

Thanks
